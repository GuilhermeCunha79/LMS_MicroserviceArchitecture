# System Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the system architecture design, offering a comprehensive overview of the project's structure, key components,
and interaction patterns. The architecture is crafted to ensure Extensibility, Configurability, and Modifiability, aligning 
with current project requirements and anticipated future needs.

## 2. System Overview

In response to evolving requirements, the system architecture has been restructured and is presented in two distinct views: 
"System As Is" and "System To Be." The "As Is" view represents the original architecture, while the "To Be" 
view illustrates the proposed future-state architecture.
